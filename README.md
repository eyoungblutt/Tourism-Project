# Tourism-Project

Week 1 Tourism Project - Nology Course

<!-- This is the first project for our Nology Course. The outline was to create a tourism website for a location of our choice. I have chosen the city of Port Macquarie.

I have firstly created a git repository and then cloned it to my computer. I have created a branch and started the HTML file. I will design the layout and what I need inside it for the main page. -->

<!--I then added a grid to help lay out the text  and added a bit of extra text-->

<!-- Today I will ge adding onto the gallery page. Adding image links and organising the layout. Whilst working today I struggled a lot with the grid and getting informaiton lining up correctly. I decided to remove all css already completed (there wasn't much) and just focus on getting all necessary content on the page. I added images for the gallery and a selection of images and very brief text for the things to do page. Next I will focus on the getting here page. -->

<!-- added the getting here page with an interactive map and recomendations on how to get to Port Macquarie. I added a link to formspree for the form so now informaiotn submitted will appear on that website. I also added images with links to appropriate websites and images tot he main navication on home page so that the images serve to navigate to the other pages. -->
