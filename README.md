# Tourism-Project

Week 1 Tourism Project - Nology Course

<!-- This is the first project for our Nology Course. The outline was to create a tourism website for a location of our choice. I have chosen the city of Port Macquarie. I wanted to create a bright and fun website. Port Macquarie is a beach side town, perfect for a summer vacation. I wanted to use a colour palette that had a fun beach vibe and that was welcoming to both adults and families.

I firstly created a git repository and then cloned it to my computer. I started by working on the HTML elements; how many pages I wanted what those pages would be, etc. Then I linked these pages together so you could move between them with the navigation bar. Once these were working I started adding external elements like images and links and also started preparing a colour palette. I used a grid for the overall layout of the pages and flex boxes for the inner columns/rows. 

If I were to repeat the project I would spend a lot more time planning the pages layout, what exactly I wanted on each page and how I wanted them all to look. I found it took me a while to find uniformity throughout the website and I spent to much time trying to work on large scale ideas instead of getting the key elements of the brief working first. I found this a great project to start building a guide for myself on constructing a website.

I also found that I moved to quickly onto the styling stage of the process. As we were expanding our knowledge base regarding styling whilst working on the project, I found I had to constantly update the work that I had already done. I decided to remove all css already completed (there wasn't much) and just focus on getting all necessary content on the page. Then I went back and started updating to SCSS. Then having to add in variables, BEM and media queries lead to further re-working. 

I feel the website that I have put together covers the breif and is also stylish and functional. I hope you enjoy it.
