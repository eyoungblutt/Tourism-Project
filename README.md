# Tourism-Project

Week 1 Tourism Project - Nology Course

<!-- This is the first project for our Nology Course. The outline was to create a tourism website for a location of our choice. I have chosen the city of Port Macquarie.

I have firstly created a git repository and then cloned it to my computer. I have created a branch and started the HTML file. I will design the layout and what I need inside it for the main page. -->

<!--I then added a grid to help lay out the text  and added a bit of extra text-->
